## Essential

- **[QB Forums](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/)**:  The one essential resource, a message board dedicated to quizbowl, accessible to QBers both young and old. Great for announcing tournaments, finding tournaments, questions, QB theorycrafting, or just general discussion. Here are some quick tips:
  - Remember to add a signature before posting!
  - The **[Best of the Best](http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=30)** section has a great collection of articles written by forum posters over time.
  - Probably the most popular way to use the site is by making an account and sorting by "View unanswered posts," though you may also lurk in the "Regional Discussion" for your particular region.
- **[QB Packets](http://quizbowlpackets.com)**: The packet archives. All publicly released question packets available here for download.
- **[QB Resource Center](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/)**: The main QB hub. This sub-url in particular is handy for finding tournaments stats, finding tournaments near you, or posting details about your own upcoming tournaments.
- **[HSQBRank](https://hsqbrank.com/)**: Fred Morlan's stats-driven rankings of the best teams in high school quizbowl. Fred spends a lot of time compiling these, and they're often great ammunition and funding-meetings: consider [donating](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=7187781).
- **[QuizDB](http://quizdb.org)**: Well, of course I was going to pub my own website...

<div id='communication' class='anchor'></div>

## Communication

- **IRC** ([Direct Link](https://client00.chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23quizbowl&server=irc.slashnet.org) and [Forum Tutorial](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6816&f=20)): some real ole' tech. Basically a live message channel, or Slack before Slack was a thing. Has largely been overtaken by the Discord these days, though some people still use it.
- **[Discord](https://discord.gg/at68qSX)** (with Forum guide [here](http://www.hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=19992)): A live message channel, or Slack _after_ Slack was a thing. Has a variety of subchannels, and its audio channel is often used to read/playtest packets.
- **Your local FB group**: Yes, this counts, too! You should look for this on your own, but regional FB groups are often great places to discuss logistics, organize practices and tournaments, and generally find likeminded people.

<div id='study' class='anchor'></div>

## Study

- **[Wiki](https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page)**: the Wiki. A good collection of study guides along the oft-asked line of questioning "How do I get good at quizbowl?" Also has some nice articles on the history of QB.
- **[Theory Subsection of Forums](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=117)**: The Theory subsection of the Forums isn't particularly well-organized (the closest anyone has gotten is collating it into the Best of the Best subforum), but if you pay attention some gems of discussion can appear.
- **[Protobowl](http://protobowl.com/)**: A live question reader (i.e. questions appear word-by-word, allowing you to buzz from your keyboard.). Contains public and private channels, so you can compete at large or practice with your friends. Notoriously controversial, as many would argue (myself included) that it incentivizes shallow stock clue memorizing and reflex buzzing, leading some to call it "the literal cancer killing quizbowl," a title Protobowl seems to now wield as a badge of pride. One thing's for sure though: it sure is fun.
- **[ReadIT](http://qbreadit.azurewebsites.net/)** (with Forum post [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=18308)): An audio QB reader. Very few packets right now, but shows promise, especially if you record packets and send them to the site maintainer.

<div id='question-dbs' class='anchor'></div>

### Question DBs

- **[QuizDB](http://quizdb.org)**: Again, _of course_ I'm going to pub my own website...
- **[Quinterest](http://quinterest.org)**: The website that inspired QuizDB. In the interest of a public market, worth checking out. Comes with **QuizBug**, a question reader. The Quinterest maintainers have mainly ceded work to QuizDB, but until Moxon is developed (see our About page), still holds use.
- **[QBDB](https://qbdb.grapesmoker.net/#browse)**: Jerry Vinokurov's Quizbowl (QB) Database (DB). Can be slightly easier to parse than QuizDB or Quinterest, but has far fewer questions available. Also comes with its question reader.
- **[aseemDB](http://aseemsdb.me/)**: Works by indexing Google cached packets rather than storing questions in its own DB, consequently giving it the effective largest search index of all. Has advanced search, though the requirement to actually download the packets you find to view the questions can be a dealbreaker.
- **[Google](https://google.com)**: Not to be facetious, but nothing beats deep research on Google and Wikipedia. More helpfully, a useful trick is to search using `site:quizbowlpackets.com [your search goes here]`, searching Google's cache of all the Packet Archives at once. This is effectively aseemDB's strategy, but more direct.
- **NAQT & HSAPQ**: These aren't free or open-source, but NAQT and HSAPQ both sell their own questions and study material. This isn't a viable option for small teams or individual players, but if you can convince your activities treasury to shell out, these can be a great tool.

<div id='3rd-party' class='anchor'></div>

### QuizDB-Based 3rd-Party Resources

Some 3rd parties have made resources using the QuizDB API (see the [About](/about) page if you'd like to make your own!) _Except unless noted, none of these resources are officially licensed by QuizDB._ They are listed here:
- A QuizDB mobile app: [https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1439712679](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1439712679). Officially _recommended_ by QuizDB.
- A question reader: [http://quizbug2.herokuapp.com](http://quizbug2.herokuapp.com).
- An Android friendly question reader: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.arjunpanickssery.quizdroid&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.arjunpanickssery.quizdroid&hl=en_US).
- An iOS friendly QuizDB mobile app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quizbuddy/id1463917543](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quizbuddy/id1463917543).

<div id='question-writing' class='anchor'></div>

## Question Writing

- **Google Sheets and Docs** (with the use of Cody Voight's [countformat tool](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=16642)): You'd be surprised to learn it, but most independent question writing is done using Google Sheets and Docs. Cody Voight's tool can help you keep track of your writing progress.
- **[QEMS2](https://github.com/grapesmoker/qems2)**: the open source tool written by Jerry Vinokurov and used by HSAPQ to write all their questions. It's a great tool, but is likely overkill for any small-to-moderate sized writing teams. If you have a lot of experience with server tools, it may be worth trying.
- **NAQT's Ginseng**: Sadly, NAQT's incredible question writing and archival tool Ginseng is not open source. I only mention it here so you're not confused as to why NAQT isn't mentioned.
- **[Jerry Vinokurov's Guide](https://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/question-writing-guidelines/)** (and don't forget the Best of the Best subforum!): The **Best of the Best** subforum again has countless articles on writing good questions, but many of the best tenets are encyclopedically listed on the ACF website.

<div id='tournament-direction' class='anchor'></div>

## Tournament Direction

- **[TD Advice](https://socalquizbowl.org/tournament-hosting-guide/)**: A massive 10,000 word+ guide to TDing. May be a little overkill, but if it's your first time TDing, this lists a lot of the common pitfalls that only experience would otherwise teach you of.
- **[Schedule Templates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tx84Hv85smes1gx16pHW6iWr_LirpQ52JOvEKJyAFEY/edit#gid=0
)** (with ACF's suggestions [here](https://acf-quizbowl.com/documents/474-2/) and NAQT's version [here](https://www.naqt.com/sct/approved-formats.jsp)): It can be surprisingly difficult to plan schedules for different tournament sizes: Cody Voight's spreadsheet quickly lists the best options. Much the same exists at the ACF and NAQT websites, but perhaps in more readable version.
- **[Round Robin Templates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYlX0fZqEJVZluxEI3m_strFsDCcm6EtWJUyTSD6ymU/edit)** (with Forum post [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=16556&p=307146)): Round Robin templates. What it says on the tin. More by the tournament wizard Cody Voight.
- **[LaTeX Schedule Templates](https://github.com/jonahgreenthal/qbschedule)**: If you'd like pretty schedules, you can play academic for a day and use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) templates.
- **[Tournament Search by Team](http://hdwhite.org/qb/stats/)** (with Forum post [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=14306)): Useful for a variety of reasons, but mainly when you want to seed teams for a potential round robin while scheduling your tournament. Also useful to brush up on how well your competition's doing.
- **[Power Matching](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=117&t=21371)**: A useful thread about _power matching_, a card-based seeding system for tournaments.

<div id='statsscoring' class='anchor'></div>

### Stats/Scoring

- **[SQBS](http://ai.stanford.edu/~csewell/sqbs/)**: The oldest and most popular (though declining fast) way to track stats during tournaments. The process of individually entering stats from a single computer is laborious, and the software's age is showing, but the QB Resource Center's reliance on SQBS generated HTML pages means it continues to hold sway.
- **[Neg5](https://neg5.org/)**: A fantastic site for live stats, both for entry across multiple moderator rooms and for viewing by players/audiences. Until it's servers are updated, it can be extremely slow--to an unusable point for large tournaments--but it's ability to allow live stats and even outputting QB Resource Center-compatible files makes it a valuable resource. Highly recommend.
- **[Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ILdWFvbtlOxLJcoRKMSWDkMu4CNtEBa-n1llEDtD1Y/edit#gid=1816381318)** (with Forum post [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=16646)): The one downside of Neg5 is that user accounts are required. If anyone forgets a password, or people forget to make accounts ahead of time, the whole effort can be doomed. Copy-and-pasting, then sharing, the linked DIY template can work well for small tournaments, while still allowing live stats and even calculating your own stats.
- **[Abacus](https://abacusquizbowl.com/)**: A web-based scorekeeper. Nothing fancy, but useful for practices.

<div id='misc' class='anchor'></div>

## Misc

- **[Tech Subforum](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=123)**: A great collection of all the QB software people have created over the ages. Not very well organized, but about as thorough as you can get.
- **Online Buzzers**: **[JustBuzz](http://www.justbuzz.in)** and **[QBBuzzer](http://qbbuzzer.com/)** (with Forum post [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=17772)): online buzzer. Great if you want to practice "for real," but don't have costly physical buzzers. Speaking of which...
- **[Anderson Buzzers](http://www.andersonbuzzersystems.com/)**: My recommendation for the best cross of cost-vs-quality in physical buzzers. About $150 a set, which pays off after about two years if your team is good about bringing them to tournaments and not breaking them intermittently.
- **[Wikipedia Featured Articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles)**: My _favorite_ way to browse Wikipedia. Had you ever heard of the [Arctic Balloon Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._A._Andr%C3%A9e%27s_Arctic_Balloon_Expedition_of_1897) before? Have you!?
- **[Fastest Finger First](http://www.crunchyroll.com/fastest-finger-first)**: Warning: quizbowl-inspired anime. I don't personally watch it, but my "coworkers" tell me it's a good TV show...
